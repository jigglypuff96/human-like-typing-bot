# human-like-typing-bot
We've built an interactive platform with user-adjustable parameters, enabling personalized AI communication for a more enriching conversational experience.
## Setup
You would need to have flutter installed. 
MacOS: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos
Windows: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows
Run >>flutter doctor to make sure you have the environment ready

## Model
When a user asks a question, we use the OpenAI API with specific constraints on the response length. After receiving the API's response, we adjust its presentation to match designated typing patterns, including hesitation delays and self-editing

## Limitations
You would need to input your own OpenAI api key and WordsAPI api key to run the model.

## Demonstrations
!. Getting a response without using our framework.
